\section{Introduction}

The \texttt{signal\_within\_radius} function identifies points within a specified radius (Region of Interest, ROI) around a central point and compresses information about these points for further use. This information can then be mapped to a data acquisition (DAQ) map, allowing integration of geometrical information of a printing object.
