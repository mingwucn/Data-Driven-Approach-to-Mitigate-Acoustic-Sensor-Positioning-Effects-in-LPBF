In the context of additive manufacturing, new opportunities for in situ monitoring are now possible with a qualify-as-you-go layer-by-layer methodology. In this study, a pair of low-cost, high-speed cameras recording the selective laser melting of maraging steel was synchronized to measure stereoscopic features of the resulting spatter. Through epipolar geometry, accurate measurements were calculated of the age, speed and direction of thousands of spatter events. Statistical analysis was performed focusing on spatter velocity with the driving hypothesis that velocity can be correlated to the weld quality and eventually leveraged in real-time process control. Opportunities, future work, and challenges are discussed.},

An aluminum component for automotive application was redesigned through topology optimization and Design for Additive Manufacturing. Simulation of the build process allowed to choose the orientation and the support location for potential lowest deformation and residual stresses. Design for Finishing was adopted in order to facilitate the machining operations after additive construction. The optical dimensional check proved a good correspondence with the tolerances predicted by process simulation and confirmed part acceptability.

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of metals faces a growing number of applications in different industries e.g. aerospace, medical, automotive, etc. Although metal AM outweighs current conventional production methods in some certain areas, the exact effect of processing conditions on the final quality and microstructure of the parts is still not well understood. An efficient way of understanding the effect of these processing conditions on a part's quality is via a calibrated and validated numerical model. Hence, in the current work a finite element model for analyzing the heat and fluid flow along with metallurgical conditions during Laser-based Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) of a titanium alloy has been developed and implemented in the commercial software code COMSOL Multiphysics. The thermal effect of the laser is modelled via a novel conico-Gaussian moving heat source, based on the concept of modified optical penetration depth. Analytical expressions for the geometrical distribution of the heat source are derived to obtain the heat source's effective depth. The model has been both verified and validated through mesh sensitivity analysis and comparison with experimental results. Furthermore, a detailed description about the role of the various driving forces for fluid flow has been given based on a thorough analysis using relevant dimensionless numbers. A systematic procedure to study the influence of neglecting the fluid flow inside the melt pool on the thermal field has also been devised. Moreover, a parametric study has been carried out to understand the effect of varying beam size and laser travel speed on heat and fluid flow conditions along with the final microstructures. The results show that changing the beam size or travel speed highly influences the grain sizes, dendritic growth directions and also the grain morphologies. To study the metallurgical conditions of the process, a microstructural sub-model has been developed. It is shown that by choosing different process parameters, one can manipulate the direction of the dendritic growth and change the grain sizes. Specifically, it is found that the overall effect of changing beam size on grain morphology is less pronounced than changing the travelling speed.},

By simultaneous in-situ synchrotron x-ray and schlieren imaging, we probe directly the interconnected fluid dynamics of the vapour jet formed by the laser and the depression it produces in the melt pool. The combined imaging shows the formation of a stable plume over stable surface depressions, which becomes chaotic following transition to a full keyhole. We quantify process instability across several parameter sets by analysing keyhole and plume morphologies, and identify a previously unreported threshold of the energy input required for stable line scans. The effect of the powder layer and its impact on process stability is explored. These high-speed visualisations of the fluid mechanics governing LPBF enable us to identify unfavourable process dynamics associated with unwanted porosity, aiding the design of process windows at higher power and speed, and providing the potential for in-process monitoring of process stability.},

  abstract = {Batch normalization (BN) is a technique to normalize activations in intermediate layers of deep neural networks. Its tendency to improve accuracy and speed up training have established BN as a favorite technique in deep learning. Yet, despite its enormous success, there remains little consensus on the exact reason and mechanism behind these improvements. In this paper we take a step towards a better understanding of BN, following an empirical approach. We conduct several experiments, and show that BN primarily enables training with larger learning rates, which is the cause for faster convergence and better generalization. For networks without BN we demonstrate how large gradient updates can result in diverging loss and activations growing uncontrollably with network depth, which limits possible learning rates. BN avoids this problem by constantly correcting activations to be zero-mean and of unit standard deviation, which enables larger gradient steps, yields faster convergence and may help bypass sharp local minima. We further show various ways in which gradients and activations of deep unnormalized networks are ill-behaved. We contrast our results against recent findings in random matrix theory, shedding new light on classical initialization schemes and their consequences.},

  abstract = {It is well known that many high-strength aluminum alloys are difficult to process with laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing because they are highly susceptible to solidification cracking. To address this issue, a metal--metal powder formulation approach was developed that allows for LPBF of previously difficult-to-print, high-performance Al alloys such as aluminum 6061 (Al6061). For the first time, a novel crack-free Al6061/AlSi10Mg alloy has been fabricated with this hybrid powder technique using relatively low laser power and no heat treatment. Compared to unmodified LPBF Al6061, the as-built hybrid Al50-50 microstructure (50~vol.\% Al6061~+~50~vol.\% AlSi10Mg) was crack free and overall porosity was reduced by 57\%. In addition, Al50-50 exhibited significantly higher average elastic modulus, yield strength, ultimate strength, fracture strain, and hardness by about 148\%, 288\%, 469\%, 943\% and 55\%, respectively. These results clearly indicate that metal--metal powder formulation is a promising method to create customized, laser-printable blends for difficult-to-process, high-performance aluminum alloys.},

This is in alignment with major trends in sustainability in today's world where a reduction in the usage of fossil fuels and other fossil fuel-dependent technologies is being realized. Additive Manufacturing technologies that have in the past been driven by the automotive industry, now present an opportunity for the automotive sector, where greater gains and benefits can be made by its adoption. Additively manufactured parts enable complex optimized design and also promote material efficiency. Moreover, system wide benefits in terms of streamlined supply chains and logistics operations are also possible and promised.

  abstract = {Cracks and keyhole pores are detrimental defects in alloys produced by laser directed energy deposition (LDED). Laser-material interaction sound may hold information about underlying complex physical events such as crack propagation and pores formation. However, due to the noisy environment and intricate signal content, acoustic-based monitoring in LDED has received little attention. This paper proposes a novel acoustic-based in-situ defect detection strategy in LDED. The key contribution of this study is to develop an in-situ acoustic signal denoising, feature extraction, and sound classification pipeline that incorporates convolutional neural networks (CNN) for online defect prediction. Microscope images are used to identify locations of the cracks and keyhole pores within a part. The defect locations are spatiotemporally registered with acoustic signal. Various acoustic features corresponding to defect-free regions, cracks, and keyhole pores are extracted and analysed in time-domain, frequency-domain, and time-frequency representations. The CNN model is trained to predict defect occurrences using the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) of the laser-material interaction sound. The CNN model is compared to various classic machine learning models trained on the denoised acoustic dataset and raw acoustic dataset. The validation results shows that the CNN model trained on the denoised dataset outperforms others with the highest overall accuracy (89\%), keyhole pore prediction accuracy (93\%), and AUC-ROC score (98\%). Furthermore, the trained CNN model can be deployed into an in-house developed software platform for online quality monitoring. The proposed strategy is the first study to use acoustic signals for in-situ defect detection in LDED process.},

Comparative research on the corrosive and biological properties of both studied materials was performed. Electrochemical corrosion tests were carried out in phosphate buffered saline at 37 {$^\circ$}C, and the degradation rate of the materials was described based on Ni ion release measurements. Cytotoxicity, bacterial growth, and adhesion to the surface of the fabricated coupons were evaluated using L929 cells and spherical Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, respectively. The in situ alloyed NiTi parts exhibit slightly lower corrosion resistance in phosphate buffered saline solution than pre-alloyed NiTi. Moreover, the passive layer formed on in situ alloyed NiTi is weaker than the one formed on the NiTi fabricated from pre-alloyed NiTi powder. Furthermore, in situ alloyed NiTi and NiTi made from pre-alloyed powders have comparable cytotoxicity and biological properties. Overall, the research has shown that nitinol sintered using in situ alloyed pure Ni and Ti is potentially useful for biomedical applications.},

Specific attention has been given to selective laser-meted (LPBFed) properties, driven through the microstructure formations and, thereby, concerning defects. The scope of the post-processing techniques to refine microstructure has also been discussed in this review paper. It has been identified that the defects are vital in LPBF process and are primarily governed by the process parameters. Therefore, a wisely chosen, optimized set of parameters can play a crucial role in minimizing defects considerably.

However, the selection of alloys, printing processes and process variables results in an exceptional diversity of microstructures, properties and defects that affect the serviceability of the printed parts. Control of these attributes using the rich knowledge base of metallurgy remains a challenge because of the complexity of the printing process. Transforming 3D designs created in the virtual world into high-quality products in the physical world needs a new methodology not commonly used in traditional manufacturing. Rapidly developing powerful digital tools such as mechanistic models and machine learning, when combined with the knowledge base of metallurgy, have the potential to shape the future of metal printing. Starting from product design to process planning and process monitoring and control, these tools can help improve microstructure and properties, mitigate defects, automate part inspection and accelerate part qualification.

  abstract = {This study investigates the use of a low cost microphone combined with state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms as online process monitoring to differentiate various materials and process regimes of Laser-Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). Three processing regimes (lack of fusion pores, conduction mode and keyhole pores) and three alloys (316L stainless steel, bronze (CuSn8), and Inconel 718) were selected. Three conventional ML algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were chosen to perform the classification tasks resulting in five main findings. First, we proved that the AE features are related to the laser-material interaction and not from undesired machine or environmental noise. Second, the process regimes are classified with high accuracy ({$>$} 87\%) regardless of the algorithms and materials. Third, it is possible to build a single model from the three materials and still reach high classification accuracy ({$>$}86\%) of the different regimes. Forth, the AE features used for the classifications are material and regime dependent. Finally, with LPBF processing of multi-materials on the rise, a strategy for classifying the material and the process regimes simultaneously using a CNN multi-label architecture reached a very high classification accuracy ({$\approx$} 93\%). The results demonstrate the potential of our approaches for online LPBF process monitoring of different materials and regimes.},

  abstract = {Achieving defect-free parts is traditionally challenging in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The mechanical properties of additively manufactured parts are highly affected by their density; as such, research in defect detection and pore prediction has gained significant interest. The process parameters, the powder characteristics, and the process environment conditions play an important role in defect occurrence. Moreover, the laser scan path affects density, especially at scan path discontinuities. In this work, the complex interaction between the process parameters and the scan path on the occurrence of subsurface pores is investigated. In the data preparation step, a synthetic data set is generated to model the melt pool morphology along the scan path. A secondary data set containing the pore space of the resulting parts is obtained via X-ray computed tomography (CT) and is registered with the synthetic data set. Machine learning models, namely, a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are then trained based on the input features to predict pore occurrence. The performance evaluation of both CNN and CVAE models on synthetic data indicates that the scan path and process parameters can be utilized in predicting pore locations. Quantitative results show that employing offline CT images a priori in training the CVAE, without the need to have CT information in the test phase, leads the CVAE model to superior performance over the CNN.},

Despite LPBF's widespread use, there still exists a need for process monitoring to ensure reliable part production and reduce post-build quality assessments. Towards this end, we develop and evaluate machine learning-based predictive models using height map-derived quality metrics for single tracks and the accompanying pyrometer and high-speed video camera data collected under a wide range of laser power and laser velocity settings. We extract physically intuitive low-level features representative of the meltpool dynamics from these sensing modalities and explore how these vary with the linear energy density. We find our Sequential Decision Analysis Neural Network (SeDANN) model -- a scientific machine learning model that incorporates physical process insights -- outperforms other purely data-driven black box models in both accuracy and speed. The general approach to data curation and adaptable nature of SeDANN's scientifically informed architecture should benefit LPBF systems with an evolving suite of sensing modalities and post-build quality measurements.},

To enable this, primary data from (8) experts in the field of AM was collected through semi-structured interviews and cross-referenced with secondary data to identify the key factors for consideration in the selection of AM equipment for aerospace applications. Four AM technologies laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), electron beam powder bed fusion (EBPBF), wire arc AM (WAAM) and laser metal deposition (LMD) were highlighted by the experts as the most appropriate for aerospace applications.

  abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is an additive manufacturing process where a heat source (such as a laser) consolidates material in powder form to build three-dimensional parts. For quality control purposes, this thesis uses real-time monitoring in L-PBF. Defects such as pores and cracks can be detected using Acoustic Emission (AE) during the powder bed selective laser melting process via the machine learning approach. This thesis investigates the performance of several Machine Learning (ML) techniques for online defect detection within the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L- PBF) process. The goal is to improve the consistency in product quality and process reliability. The application of acoustic emission (AE) sensors to receive elastic waves during the printing process is a cost-effective way of meeting such a goal.    For the first step, stainless steel 316L was produced via eight parameters. The acoustic emission signals received during the printing and data collection steps are analyzed using an AE sensor under various process parameters. Several time and frequency-domain features were extracted from data during the mining process from the AE signals.   K-means clustering is employed during unsupervised learning, and a neural network approach was used for the supervised machine learning on the dataset. Data labelling is conducted for different laser powers, clustering results, and signal time durations. The results showed the potential of real-time quality monitoring using AE in the L-PBF process.  Some process parameters within this project were intentionally adjusted to create three various levels of defects in H13 tool steel samples. First classes were printed with minimum defects, second classes with intentional cracks, and last classes with intentional cracks and porosities. AE signals were acquired during the samples' manufacturing process. Three different machine learning (ML) techniques were applied to analyze and interpret the data. First, using a hierarchical K-means clustering method, the data was labelled. This was followed by a supervised deep learning neural network (DL) to match acoustic signals with defect type. Second, a principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) enabled the fast detection of defects, which is suitable for online monitoring. Third, a variational auto-encoder (VAE) approach was used to obtain a general feature of the signal, which could be used as an input for the classifier.  Quality trends in AE signals collected from 316L samples were successfully detected using a supervised DL trained on the H13 tool steel dataset. The VAE approach shows a new method for detecting defects within the L-PBF processes, which would eliminate the need for model training in different materials.},

This approach is taken from the perspective of a production organization. Findings A certification roadmap is proposed that references industry requirements at the relevant phases of the roadmap. Each phase of the roadmap acts as a decision gate for progression to the next. Originality/value Qualification and certification of metal laser powder bed fusion is currently a challenge within the aerospace industry. From an aerospace point of view, the qualification and certification of this relatively new manufacturing process should not have to be any different from traditional manufacturing processes, although with extensive quality control and regulatory oversight. This paper proposes a means for fulfilling these requirements chronologically and provides guidance on ensuring such quality control throughout the manufacturing system lifecycle. This roadmap provides insight into the qualification and certification of laser powder bed fusion for aerospace applications and provides value for future industrial feasibility studies.},

Four states of IN718 powder (virgin, used, overflow and spatter) were characterized in terms of their morphology, flowability and physico-chemical properties. Studies showed that used and overflow powders were almost identical. The fine particle-size distribution of the virgin powder, in which 50\% of particles were found to be below the nominal particle-size distribution (PSD), was recognized as the main reason for its lower flowability and the main cause of the differentiation between virgin, used and overflow powders. Only spatter powder was found to be degraded enough to preclude its direct LPBF reuse. The oxygen content in the spatter powder exceeded the limit value for IN718 by 290 ppm, and aluminum oxide spots were found on the spatter particles surfaces. Laser absorption analysis showed 10 pp higher laser absorption compared to the other powders. The results of evaluation showed that IN718 powder is resistant to multiple uses in the LPBF process. Due to the low degradation rate of IN718 powder, overflow powder can be re-enabled for multiple uses with a proper recycling strategy.},

In pursuit of this goal, the objectives of this work are two-fold:(1) Quantify the count (number), size and location of pores as a function of three LPBF process parameters, namely, the hatch spacing (H), laser velocity (V), and laser power (P).(2) Monitor and identify process conditions that are liable to cause porosity through analysis of in-process layer-by-layer optical images of the build invoking multifractal and spectral graph theoretic features.This is important because porosity has a significant impact on the functional integrity of LPBF parts, such as fatigue life. Furthermore, linking process conditions to sensor signatures and defects is the first-step towards in-process quality assurance in LPBF. To achieve the first objective, titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) test cylinders of 10 mm diameter {\texttimes} 25 mm height were built under differing H, V, and P settings on a commercial LPBF machine (EOS M280). The effect of these parameters on count, size and location of pores was quantified based on X-ray computed tomography (XCT) images. To achieve the second objective, layerwise optical images of the powder bed were acquired as the parts were being built. Spectral graph theoretic and multifractal features were extracted from the layer-by-layer images for each test part. Subsequently, these features were linked to the process parameters using machine learning approaches. Through these image-based features, process conditions under which the parts were built was identified with the statistical fidelity over 80\% (F-score).},

  abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an emerging additive manufacturing technique that is currently adopted by a number of industries for its ability to directly fabricate complex near-net-shaped components with minimal material wastage. Two major limitations of LPBF, however, are that the process inherently produces components containing some amount of porosity and that fabricated components tend to suffer from poor repeatability. While recent advances have allowed the porosity level to be reduced to a minimum, consistent porosity-free fabrication remains elusive. Therefore, it is important to understand how porosity affects mechanical properties in alloys fabricated this way in order to inform the safe design and application of components. To this aim, this article will review recent literature on the effects of porosity on tensile properties, fatigue life, impact and fracture toughness, creep response, and wear behavior. As the number of alloys that can be fabricated by this technology continues to grow, this overview will mainly focus on four alloys that are commonly fabricated by LPBF---Ti-6Al-4~V, Inconel 718, AISI 316L, and AlSi10Mg.},

  abstract = {This study demonstrates the significant effect of the recoil pressure and Marangoni convection in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) of 316L stainless steel. A three-dimensional high fidelity powder-scale model reveals how the strong dynamical melt flow generates pore defects, material spattering (sparking), and denudation zones. The melt track is divided into three sections: a topological depression, a transition and a tail region, each being the location of specific physical effects. The inclusion of laser ray-tracing energy deposition in the powder-scale model improves over traditional volumetric energy deposition. It enables partial particle melting, which impacts pore defects in the denudation zone. Different pore formation mechanisms are observed at the edge of a scan track, at the melt pool bottom (during collapse of the pool depression), and at the end of the melt track (during laser power ramp down). Remedies to these undesirable pores are discussed. The results are validated against the experiments and the sensitivity to laser absorptivity is discussed.},

In this technology review, new industrial improvements in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of metals are discussed. LPBF has the lowest build rate among all AM processes that produce metals such as electron beam powder bed fusion, direct energy deposition, binder jetting and sheet lamination. The findings of the current research show that the most innovations and future directions of LPBF printers are toward increasing the speed of the process by using interchangeable feedstock chamber, closed-loop control powder handling, automated powder sieving, multi-layer concurrent printing, 2-axis coating and multi powder hoppers. To increase the speed of the process, the new improvements for transferring time and using fast lasers are presented. Another innovation in the building of LPBF printers is enhancing part quality by improving lasers with the shorter beam diameter, multi-lasers, uniform inert gas flow, accurate positioning systems, using high vacuum systems and using sensors and automation.},

First, we compare the behavior of first- and second-order implicit time-stepping schemes on a fixed domain. While both methods yield comparable accuracies in the pre-asymptotic regime, the second-order method eventually outperforms the first-order method. However, the oscillations present in the pre-asymptotic range of the second-order method can render it less suitable for simulating LPBF processes. Then, we consider sudden domain extensions resulting from subsequently adding new layers of material with ambient temperature. We model this extension on the continuous level in an energy conservative manner. The discontinuities introduced here reduce the convergence order for both time-stepping schemes to 0.75. First and second order accuracy could only be achieved by strongly grading the time-steps towards the domain expansion.},

Then, a novel image and data processing method was proposed to extract the critical and high-level melt pool features data. Three intelligent machine learning algorithms of back propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM), and deep belief network (DBN) were finally developed to match the features data with porosity modes. Results show that it is feasible and effective for the proposed method to realize porosity classification during the SLM process, which can provide a potential to reduce porosity defects.},

In this work, based on dual-wavelength thermometry, a coaxial melt pool temperature measurement system with a single high-speed camera in the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process is developed, including the design of the relay and optical path amplification system, and the beam splitting and chromatic aberration correction system. Moreover, a dual-waveband image-matching method with sub-pixel accuracy, and an overall parameter calibration and optimization method are proposed to improve the accuracy of the coaxial temperature measurement system. Besides, the validation experiment measured by a high-temperature blackbody furnace and a standard photoelectric pyrometer indicates that the temperature measuring error of the developed system is less than 1\%. The melt pool characteristics including the temperature distribution, profile, temperature gradient, and cooling rate were measured by the developed coaxial temperature measurement system, and the distribution of average temperature and peak temperature under different linear energy densities during single-line printing was also compared and analyzed. The single-line printing results of different parameters show that the higher the linear energy density, the higher the average temperature and peak temperature of the melt pool, and the optimized parameters minimize the fluctuation of melt pool temperature and are more favorable to the formation of high-quality parts. In multi-layer printing mode, the heat accumulation is strong, resulting in the slow cooling rate of the melt pool.},

Widespread adoption of it and similar additive technologies is hampered by poor understanding of laser-metal interactions under such extreme thermal regimes. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of pore formation and liquid-solid interface dynamics during typical laser powder bed fusion conditions using in situ X-ray imaging and multi-physics simulations. Pores are revealed to form during changes in laser scan velocity due to the rapid formation then collapse of deep keyhole depressions in the surface which traps inert shielding gas in the solidifying metal. We develop a universal mitigation strategy which eliminates this pore formation process and improves the geometric quality of melt tracks. Our results provide insight into the physics of laser-metal interaction and demonstrate the potential for science-based approaches to improve confidence in components produced by laser powder bed fusion.},

  abstract = {Quality monitoring in Additive Manufacturing (AM) is currently mostly based on temperature measurements of the process zone or on layer/piecewise high-resolution surface imaging. To this aim, various sensors, such as pyrometers, photodiodes, and matrix CCD detectors, have been tested. These standard temperature measurements, however, do not provide a comprehensive description of the process dynamics, as they are just limited to surface observations. Furthermore, they are often used for post-factum inspection, i.e., after the piece is partially or even completely produced. No robust and low-cost methods are so far known to monitor the quality of laser processes in real-time. To close this gap, we propose an innovative approach for online quality monitoring of additive manufacturing employing acoustic emissions (AE). In fact, AE signals can provide in-depth information about the process, e.g., melting, resolidification, delamination, and cracking of the workpiece. Moreover, the sintering or melting of the metal powder has several unique acoustic signatures that can be detected and interpreted in terms of quality. In our approach, the correlation of the acoustic signals to the quality of the produced pieces is made by Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. Specifically, AI in the form of Machine Learning is used to perform a data-driven extraction and recognition of the unique acoustic signatures from different sintering or melting events. In this contribution, we present a summary of our results in the fields of selective laser melting and laser welding, which have similar underlying mechanisms. At first, we discuss how, by using AE, we can classify different types of defects and porosity content in both processes. Afterward, with the aid of high-speed X-ray imaging, we demonstrate the real-time performance of our approach in the classification of transient events/regimes that are critical for the final quality---in particular conduction, stable keyhole, unstable keyhole, pore formation, and blowout. Finally, we present the future possibilities in terms of control of AM processes based on AI.},

  abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a technique of additive manufacturing (AM) that is often used to construct a metal object layer-by-layer. The quality of AM builds depends to a great extent on the minimization of different defects such as porosity and cracks that could occur by process deviation during machine operation. Therefore, there is a need to develop new analytical methods and tools to equip the LPBF process with the inspection frameworks that assess the process condition and monitor the porosity defect in real-time. Advanced sensing is recently integrated with the AM machines to cope with process complexity and improve information visibility. This opportunity lays the foundation for online monitoring and assessment of the in-process build layer. This study presents the hybrid deep neural network structure with two types of input data to monitor the process parameters that result in porosity defect in cylinders' layers. Results demonstrate that statistical features extracted by wavelet transform and texture analysis along with original powder bed images, assist the model in reaching a robust performance. In order to illustrate the fidelity of the proposed model, the capability of the main pipeline is examined and compared with different machine learning models. Eventually, the proposed framework identified the process conditions with an F-score of 97.14\%. This salient flaw detection ability is conducive to repair the defect in real-time and assure the quality of the final part before the completion of the process.},

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to monitor the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process using an array  of heterogeneous sensors. This goal is termed as build status monitoring. The overarching aim is  to usher a qualify-as-you-build quality assurance paradigm in LPBF whereby incipient build  defects are detected through analysis of data acquired from in-process sensors. This will allow  opportune preventive action to avert propagation of build defects across multiple layers. In pursuit  of this goal, a commercial LPBF machine at the National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST) was integrated with three types of sensors, namely, a photodetector, high-speed video  camera, and SWIR thermal camera with the following objective: to develop and apply a spectral  graph theoretic approach to monitor the LPBF build status from the data acquired by the three  sensors. This objective will lead to early identification of incipient defects that afflict LPBF despite  extensive process automation. The proposed approach is illustrated with experimental sensor data  acquired during LPBF of a part having a steep overhang feature of {\textasciitilde} 40.5o  . Parts with such steep  overhang features may exacerbate deleterious consequences such as poor surface finish, porosity,  and distortion. Hence, close monitoring of the signal patterns during scanning of overhang areas  is consequential for early detection of build defects. The proposed approach detected differences  between overhang and non-overhang build status for different sensors with the statistical fidelity  (F-score) of 95\% from thermal camera signatures to 79\% with the photodetector. In comparison,  conventional signal analysis techniques - e.g., neural networks, support vector machines, linear  discriminant analysis, etc., are evaluated with F-score in the range of 40\% to 60\%. As part of our  forthcoming work, this study will be further expanded to include more build defects, e.g., due to  material contamination.},

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to monitor the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process using an array of sensors so that a record may be made of those temporal and spatial build locations where there is a high probability of defect formation. In pursuit of this goal, a commercial LPBF machine at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was integrated with three types of sensors, namely, a photodetector, high-speed visible camera, and short wave infrared (SWIR) thermal camera with the following objectives: (1) to develop and apply a spectral graph theoretic approach to monitor the LPBF build condition from the data acquired by the three sensors; (2) to compare results from the three different sensors in terms of their statistical fidelity in distinguishing between different build conditions. The first objective will lead to early identification of incipient defects from in-process sensor data. The second objective will ascertain the monitoring fidelity tradeoff involved in replacing an expensive sensor, such as a thermal camera, with a relatively inexpensive, low resolution sensor, e.g., a photodetector. As a first-step toward detection of defects and process irregularities that occur in practical LPBF scenarios, this work focuses on capturing and differentiating the distinctive thermal signatures that manifest in parts with overhang features. Overhang features can significantly decrease the ability of laser heat to diffuse from the heat source. This constrained heat flux may lead to issues such as poor surface finish, distortion, and microstructure inhomogeneity. In this work, experimental sensor data are acquired during LPBF of a simple test part having an overhang angle of 40.5\,deg. Extracting and detecting the difference in sensor signatures for such a simple case is the first-step toward in situ defect detection in additive manufacturing (AM). The proposed approach uses the Eigen spectrum of the spectral graph Laplacian matrix as a derived signature from the three different sensors to discriminate the thermal history of overhang features from that of the bulk areas of the part. The statistical accuracy for isolating the thermal patterns belonging to bulk and overhang features in terms of the F-score is as follows: (a) F-score of 95\% from the SWIR thermal camera signatures; (b) 83\% with the high-speed visible camera; (c) 79\% with the photodetector.

The 197 fatigue bars were printed using the same laser power but with varied scanning speeds. These actions led to variations in the geometries of microscale pores, and such variations were characterized using micro-computed tomography. To generate differences in surface roughness in fatigue bars, half of the samples were grit-blasted and the other half were machined. Fatigue behaviors were analyzed with respect to surface roughness and statistics of the pores. For the grit-blasted samples, the contour laser scan in the LPBF strategy led to a pore-depletion zone isolating surface and internal pores with different features. For the machined samples, where surface pores resemble internal pores, the fatigue life was highly correlated with the average pore size and projected pore area in the plane perpendicular to the stress direction. Finally, a machine learning model using a drop-out neural network (DONN) was employed to establish a link between surface and pore features to the fatigue data (logN), and good prediction accuracy was demonstrated. Besides predicting fatigue lives, the DONN can also estimate the prediction uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Sensor integration for in situ monitoring during additive manufacturing promises to enhance control over the process and assures quality in the fabricated workpieces. Acoustic emissions from the process zone of the laser powder-bed fusion process carry information about the events and failure modes of the printed workpiece. Analysis of acoustic signals emitted during different laser regimes, such as conduction, keyhole, etc. in time, frequency and time-frequency domains could provide quantitative information about the underlying physical mechanisms. This article reports a statistical analysis of the features in acoustic signals to perceive the characteristics of failure modes occurring during layering of stainless steel 316L. The visualization of the feature space distribution that corresponds to different failure modes shows the potentials of applying machine learning for in situ classification. The paper also proposes strategies in terms of data acquisition and preprocessing for building a comprehensive monitoring system.},

  abstract = {Metal-based Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) suffers from a lack of repeatability and is challenging to model, making their quality monitoring essential and demanding. The reason lies in the high dynamics taking place during the interaction of the laser with metallic powders. To bring this technology to mass production, industries are only interested in the process regime where the built layer's quality meets their standards. All other process regimes leading to poor mechanical properties and/or defect formation such as balling, Lack of Fusion (LoF) pores, keyhole pores, delamination, and crack propagation irrespective of their different regimes are considered anomalies. Today, the common methodology for monitoring uses conventional/supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for the classification task. However, it requires collecting a balanced dataset corresponding to each investigated regime from the sensors, which is very expensive and time-consuming. As an alternative, the article proposes a semi-supervised approach where the defect-free regime can be differentiated from the anomalies by familiarising the ML algorithms only with the distribution of acoustic signatures corresponding to the defect-free regime. This work presents two generative Convolutional Neural Network architectures based on Variational Auto-Encoder and General Adversarial Network. As a result, we could classify the anomaly regimes with 96 and 97\% accuracy, respectively.},

  abstract = {Harnessing the full potential of the metal-based Laser Powder Bed Fusion process (LPBF) relies heavily on how effectively the overall reliability and stability of the manufactured part can be ensured. To this aim, the recent advances in sensorization and processing of the associated signals using Machine Learning (ML) techniques have made in situ monitoring a viable alternative to post-mortem techniques such as X-ray tomography or ultrasounds for the assessment of parts. Indeed, the primary advantage of in situ monitoring over post-mortem analysis is that the process can be stopped in case of discrepancies, saving resources. Additionally, mitigations to repair the discrepancies can also be performed. However, the in situ monitoring strategies based on classifying processing regimes reported in the literature so far operate on signals of fixed length in time, constraining the generalization of the trained ML model by not allowing monitoring processes with heterogeneous laser scanning strategies. As a part of this work, we try to bridge this gap by developing a hybrid Deep Learning (DL) model by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) that can operate over variable time-scales. The proposed hybrid DL model was trained on signals obtained from a heterogeneous time-synced sensing system consisting of four sensors, namely back reflection (BR), Visible, Infra-Red (IR), and structure-borne Acoustic Emission (AE). The signals captured different phenomena related to the LPBF process zone and were used to classify three regimes: Lack of Fusion (LoF), conduction mode and Keyhole. Specifically, these three regimes were induced by printing cubes out of austenitic Stainless steel (316~L) on a mini-LPBF device with operando high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging and signal acquisition with the developed heterogeneous sensing system. The operando X-ray imaging analysis ensured that the regimes correlated with the defined process parameters. During the validation procedure of the trained hybrid DL model, the model predicted three regimes with an accuracy of about 98\% across various time scales, ranging from 0.5~ms to 4~ms. In addition to tracking the model performance, a sensitivity analysis of the trained hybrid model was conducted, which showed that the BR and AE sensors carried more relevant information to guide the decision-making process than the other two sensors used in this work.},

So far, algorithms trained for monitoring a particular material type cannot be re-used to monitor another material in Additive Manufacturing (AM). This is a topic rarely researched in AM. Inspired by the idea of transfer learning in ML, we demonstrate the knowledge learned by the two native Deep Learning (DL) networks, namely VGG and ResNets, on four LPBF process mechanisms such as balling, Lack of Fusion (LoF) pores, conduction mode, and keyhole pores in stainless steel (316L) can be transferred to bronze (CuSn8). In this work, the spectrograms computed using Wavelet Transforms (WT) on Acoustic Emissions (AE) during the LBPF process of stainless steel and bronze are used for training the two DL networks. Either network is first trained for classification by spectrograms representing four mechanisms during the processing of stainless steel. The trained model is then re-trained using transfer learning with spectrograms from bronze data for a similar classification task. The accuracy of the two networks during transfer learning shows that it is effectively possible to learn transferable features from one material to another with minimum network training time and dataset collection.},

Two types of brackets in stainless steel AISI-316L grade for aerospace applications were realized through laser powder bed fusion method. Detailed characterization, analysis and structural testing were performed on the powder, test coupons and the component itself to qualify these brackets for the intended application. Significant amount of material removal, excessive machining time and associated problems such as residual stresses and warpage envisaged in the conventional manufacturing route have been avoided. The mechanical properties meet the requirements specified in ASTM F 3184-16 standard and were similar to or better than vis-{\`a}-vis that can be achieved through forged route manufacturing. Minor distortion was noticed on thin wall regions which have been avoided in the next hardware by distortion compensation and adding extra stock at thin sections which can be removed by minimum machining. Non-destructive testing was performed by macro CT and brackets were found to be free from defects\,{$>$}\,100~{\textmu}m. Further, there is scope for topology optimization through design for additive manufacturing~(DfAM) and achieving weight savings for future requirements.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Spatially resolved temperature measurements and understanding the local heat-affected zone (HAZ) are of urgent importance in metal additive manufacturing (AM). Many experiments have used infrared (IR) temperature measurements at the build surface, but there is little experimental work measuring temperatures below the surface. Measurements below the top surface are vital to understand how the heating of additional build layers affects the temperature history of previously printed layers, especially in thin geometries. A thin metal plate with incident laser power can reasonably represent such thin geometries, for example, an overhang feature of an actual part undergoing laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). As a part of this work, we describe the design, construction, and calibration of an experimental setup that allows direct measurement of temperature distributions on the bottom side of a metal substrate. This is accomplished using a high-speed IR camera (2000 fps) positioned below a thin Inconel 625 substrate of known thickness (500 {$\mu$}m) and emissivity. The top side is irradiated with a high-power ytterbium fiber laser, while temperature distributions are measured on the bottom surface. The local temperature on the bottom side is resolved with a spatial resolution of 200 {$\mu$}m in the x and y directions. Local temperature distributions and HAZ dimensions are reported for single-track scans as a function of the laser power. The insights derived from this study will ultimately establish a fundamental link between laser processing parameters, local thermal history, and printed part properties.},

  abstract = {The non-equilibrium phase evolution during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of AlSi10Mg alloy is thoroughly characterized and analyzed by means of advanced electron microscopy and analytical simulation of rapid solidification phenomenon. The evolution of microstructural strengthening agents such as inter-cellular eutectic phase and intra-cellular precipitates is presented in correspondence with the local variation of cellular/dendritic solidification patterns within a typical melt pool. The eutectic phase exhibits two different morphologies: lamellar and fibrous. As with the cell size variation, the overall volume fraction of eutectic phase and the lamella spacing is shown to gradually decrease by moving away from the melt-pool boundary (MPB), i.e., through crossing over from a coarse to a fine cellular zone. The eutectic-free regions within the {$\alpha$}-Al cells contain a large number density of nano-sized precipitates that are predominantly Si-rich and are either fully or semi-coherent with the Al matrix. The formation of nano-precipitates is linked to the increased (non-equilibrium) solubility limits of {$\alpha$}-Al cells due to the rapid solidification effect. For the first time, we identify such nano-precipitates with non-equilibrium crystal structures and morphologies: ``Spheres'' and ``Ellipsoids'' with Face Centered Cubic (FCC), and ``Plates'' and ``Needles'' with a Diamond Cubic (DC) superlattice structure that emerges from within the Al matrix. The microstructure in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) right underneath the MPB exhibits an absence of cell boundaries and eutectic phases while consisting primarily of large Si-rich and Mg-rich precipitates. Finally, the local variation of nano-hardness across a solidified melt pool is shown to correlate well with the corresponding profile of microstructural refinement, i.e., exhibiting a minimum at the HAZ and a peak at around the melt-pool centerline. The findings here can significantly advance the state of knowledge for the strengthening behavior in an as-built LPBF-processed AlSi10Mg alloy.},

  abstract = {Keyhole pore formation is one of the most detrimental subsurface defects in the laser metal additive manufacturing process. However, effective ways to mitigate keyhole pore formation beyond tuning laser processing conditions during keyhole mode laser melting are still lacking. Here we report a novel approach to mitigate keyhole pore formation during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process by using stable nanoparticles. The critical keyhole depth for keyhole pore generation (i.e., the largest keyhole depth without keyhole pore formation) during LPBF of Al6061 increases from 246~{\textmu}m to 454~{\textmu}m (85\% increase) after adding TiC nanoparticles. In-depth x-ray imaging studies and thermo-fluid dynamics simulation enable us to identify that two mechanisms work together to mitigate keyhole pore generation: (1) adding nanoparticles prevents the keyhole from collapsing by increasing the liquid viscosity to impede the protrusion development; (2) adding nanoparticles slows down the keyhole pore movement by increasing the liquid viscosity, resulting in the recapturing of the pore by the keyhole. We further demonstrate that adding TiC nanoparticles can also eliminate the keyhole fluctuation induced keyhole pore during LPBF of Al6061. Our research provides a potential way to mitigate keyhole pore formation for defect lean metal additive manufacturing.},

Those results showed a martensite microstructure was obtained in the hardened zone over the entire depth of the specimen and indicated its suitability for laser hardening. The average hardness of the fully hardened zone increased from 300 HV to approximately 440 HV. The martensitic transformation caused an increase in the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS) of 66 \% and 28 \%, respectively, and decreased the level of ductility to 5\% of elongation. Fracture analysis of the tensile specimens showed shallow dimples in the center and shear lips on the edges and in the laser hardened zones. The crack was initiated by the lack of fusion just below the surface and was characteristic for LPBF material tensile specimens. Based on bending tests, improper localization of the local hardened zones in the component, i.e. in areas of high plastic deformation, led to the formation of a microcrack due to a significant reduction in ductility and microstructural inhomogeneities. The knowledge of the strategy and technological parameters of the hardening process of heat-treated LPBF medium manganese steel will be beneficial to the automotive industry as this material class is gaining increasing attention.},

Maraging steels are used in aerospace applications due to their tremendous strength to weight proportion.

Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), and Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) techniques in the 3D printing process are widely used to manufacture the maraging steel. The mechanical features of LPBF maraging steel are more when compared to the wrought alloy. The variable process parameters in the LPBF method are laser power, laser scanning velocity, hatch distance, layer thickness, and build direction. Such process parameters are manipulated adequately to fabricate the final component; otherwise, they cause porosity, cracks, low density, and balling. Depending on the laser-metal interaction, these defects affect the microstructure, relative density, mechanical, and surface features of the maraging steel component fabricated in the LPBF process.

For this purpose, powders that were stored and aged under humid conditions in a climatic chamber for a certain period of time and subsequently dried in some instances were manufactured by LPBF. Afterwards, a comparison of the part density, mechanical properties and the surface quality of the LPBF parts was carried out. To gain a better understanding of the influences of the storage conditions considered on the powder and its behavior as feedstock, all aged powders were thoroughly characterized. A variation of the process parameters, laser power and scanning speed, were tested in order to identify the optimal parameter setting for the use of fresh, aged, and dried powder. It was found that the powders adsorb the water molecules in a mostly physical way. The natural oxide layer on the powder particles remains unaffected by the storage conditions. XPS investigations do not provide any clear evidence for the formation of hydroxides on the surface of the particles. Overall, the results of the printed parts show that the use of powder, which was stored under humid conditions, results in a lower part density and lower mechanical strength. This deterioration in processability can be reversed by drying the powder in a vacuum drying oven.},

Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is the most used metal additive manufacturing technique, and it is based on the efficient interaction between a high-energy laser and a metal powder feedstock. To make LPBF more cost-efficient and environmentally friendly, it is of paramount importance to recycle (reuse) the unfused powder from a build job. However, since the laser--powder interaction involves complex physics phenomena and generates by-products which might affect the integrity of the feedstock and the final build part, a better understanding of the overall process should be attained. The present review paper is focused on the clarification of the interaction between laser and metal powder, with a strong focus on its side effects.},

This works examines the possibility of in-situ detection of keyholing porosity and balling instabilities. Specifically, a visiblelight high speed camera with a fixed field of view is used to study the morphology of L-PBF melt pools in the Inconel 718 material system. A scale-invariant description of melt pool morphology is constructed using Computer Vision techniques and unsupervised Machine Learning is used to differentiate between observed melt pools. By observing melt pools produced across process space, in-situ signatures are identified which may indicate flaws such as those observed ex-situ. This linkage of ex-situ and in-situ morphology enabled the use of supervised Machine Learning to classify melt pools observed (with the high speed camera) during fusion of nonbulk geometries such as overhangs.},

This work aims at enriching existing approaches in this field. We propose a method for real-time detection of process instabilities that can lead to defects. Hard X-ray radiography is used for the ground truth observations of the sub-surface events that are critical for the quality. A~deep artificial neural network is applied to reveal the unique signatures of those events in wavelet spectrograms from the laser back-reflection and acoustic emission signals. The autonomous classification of the revealed signatures is tested on real-life data, while the real-time performance is reached by means of parallel computing. The confidence of the quality classification ranges between 71\% and 99\%, with a temporal resolution down to 2\,ms and a computation time per classification task as low as 2\,ms. This approach is a new paradigm in the digitization of industrial processes and can be exploited to provide feedbacks in a closed-loop quality control system.},

The thermo-mechanical analysis showed that the deformation of the component decreases with an increase in the dwell time. The longitudinal design of the component show a uniform decrease in the deformation with dwell time whereas the transverse design shows a variation in the results. For a dwell time of 5 sec, the distortion in the thin section reduces by 43.27\% whereas increases by 48.7\% in the thin section. This shows that different process parameters can be employed for varying geometry to obtain optimal built component.},

In this work, we compare two dense specimens produced from virgin and surface-modified CuCr1 powder. Furthermore, a third sample fabricated from surface-modified powder is characterized to understand an abnormal porosity content initially detected through Archimedes testing. Utilizing high-resolution micro-CT scans, the nature of the defects present in the different samples is revealed. Pores are analyzed in terms of size, morphology and spatial distribution. The micro-CT data reveal that the virgin CuCr1 dense specimen displays keyhole pores plus pit cavities spanning multiple layer thicknesses. On the other hand, the sample fabricated with the surface-modified CuCr1 powder mainly contains small and spherical equi-distributed metallurgical defects. Finally, the CT analysis of the third specimen reveals the presence of a W contamination, favoring lack-of-fusion pores between subsequent LPBF layers. The LPBF melting mode (keyhole or conductive), the properties of the material, and the potential presence of contaminants are connected to the different porosity types and discussed.},

This work was aimed at finding the process window for the LPBF manufacturing of defect-free components of AA7075 alloy. Optimization of the parameters was performed at each stage of the multi-stage research, i.e. for single tracks, thin walls and volumetric specimens. At each stage, the relation between LPBF parameters and defect formation with a focus on hot cracking was investigated and discussed. Due to the optimization of process parameters, the density of volumetric specimens above 99 \% was reached and vaporization losses of the alloying elements were significantly reduced, but solidification cracks could not be eliminated. It was found that solidification cracks were formed by the liquid film rupture mode, mainly along columnar grain boundaries. The EDS microanalysis showed intergranular microsegregation, not only of the main alloying elements (Zn, Mg, Cu) but also of minor elements such as Si. Silicon may play a significant role in increasing susceptibility to cracking by increasing the stability of the liquid film. Reduction in the silicon impurity content in the AA7075 powder gives a chance to reduce susceptibility to cracking with no change of the alloy specification.},

Considering the problem of forming an object having lattices inside it to reduce the thermal distortion, we perform a lattice density distribution optimization and its experimental verification.

The lattices are approximately handled as solid materials having effective stiffness calculated by the homogenization method. In the experiment, the laser powder bed fusion is introduced to fabricate test pieces. The test pieces are partially cut from the baseplate by a wire electric discharge machine, and the edge clearance caused by warping deformation is measured. The thermo-mechanical analysis is also introduced for the mechanical interpretation of the results. The reduction rate of the clearance caused by warping deformation in the experiment was 10.4\%--24.8\% in the quasi 2D example (comparison with 61.0\%--91.4\% volume fraction uniform lattices and a solid test piece) and 6.0\% in the 3D example (comparison with the same volume fraction uniform lattice with the optimal lattice).},

In-situ process monitoring is a potential approach to this problem. This work investigates the feasibility of using photodiodes for quality monitoring and correlates photodiode signals with X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) based on deep learning. A cube of Ti-6Al-4V grade 23 was produced with optimum energy density parameters. Porosity was analyzed using X-CT to help understand the size, shape, location, and the number of pores formed. The photodiode signals were recorded using the coaxial melt-pool monitoring system on an in-house developed LPBF machine. The photodiode signals collected during processing were segmented per layer accordingly using different window sizes. The classifiers were trained to predict the presence and location of porosities considering the inter-hatch effect. Moreover, different models were trained and compared, which will act as a baseline for further research. The results showed that using photodiode signals can yield a prediction sensitivity of 68\% and an accuracy of 84\% for pores with a cross-section larger than 100 {$\mu$}m2, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.86. These findings suggest that photodiodes can be a promising approach to quality monitoring in LPBF with sub-layer spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {In laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), defects such as pores or cracks can seriously affect the final part quality and lifetime. Keyhole porosity, being one type of porosity defects in LPBF, results from excessive energy density which may be due to changes in process parameters (namely, laser power and scan speed) and/or result from the part's geometry and/or hatching strategies. To study the possible occurrence of keyhole pores, experimental work and simulations were carried out for optimum and high volumetric energy density conditions in Ti-6Al-4~V grade 23. By decreasing the scanning speed from 1000 to 500~mm/s for a fixed laser power of 170~W, keyhole porosities are formed and later observed by X-ray computed tomography. Melt pool images are recorded in real-time during the LPBF process by using a high-speed coaxial Near-Infrared (NIR) camera monitoring system. The recorded images are then pre-processed using a set of image processing steps to generate binary images. From the binary images, geometrical features of the melt pool and features that characterize the spatter particle formation and ejection from the melt pool are calculated. The experimental data clearly show spatter patterns in case of keyhole porosity formation at low scan speed. A correlation between number of pores and amount of spatter is observed. Besides the experimental work, a previously developed high fidelity finite volume numerical model was used to simulate the melt pool dynamics with similar process parameters as used during the experiments. Simulation results illustrate and confirm the keyhole porosity formation by decreasing laser scan speed.},

  abstract = {In order to develop smart laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) devices that autonomously identify a defect and remove it during the process for first-time-right and zero-defect parts, it is important to develop reliable on-machine defect measuring capabilities. As defects in LPBF parts often occur below the layer that is being processed, capturing the information of a printing layer may not give information about physical phenomena that are occurring below this layer. Therefore, to predict volumetric features such as porosity only by looking at the layer being processed, the correlation between process signatures identified in-process and defects measured via post-process inspection methods (for example X-ray computed tomography) needs to be conducted. Hence, in situ monitoring and post-process metrology form a basis to better understand the fundamental physics involved in an LPBF process and ultimately to determine its stability. By utilizing high-speed imaging, various process signatures are produced during single-track formation of 316L stainless steel with various combinations of laser power and scan speed. In this study, we evaluate whether these signatures can be used to detect the onset of potential defects. To identify process signatures, image segmentation and feature detection are applied to the monitoring data along the line scans. The process signatures determined in the current study are mainly related to the features like the process zone length-to-width ratio, process zone area, process zone mean intensity, spatter speed and number of spatters. It is shown that the scan speed has a significant impact on the process stability and spatter formation during single-track fusion. Simulations with similar processing conditions were also performed to predict melt pool geometric features. Post-process characterization techniques such as X-ray computed tomography and 2.5-D surface topography measurement were carried out for a quality check of the line track. An attempt was made to correlate physics-based features with process-related defects and a correlation between the number of keyhole porosities, and the number of spatters was observed for the line tracks.},

The superior and consistent mechanical and corrosion properties of LPBF-printed components are essential for engineering applications. The 316L stainless steel (SS) is an essential alloy with widespread applications from household items to nuclear and aerospace industries. Extensive research is conducted to understand and improve the mechanical properties of LPBF printed 316L SS. Studying the corrosion behavior of LPBF printed 316L has attracted only limited attention. Additionally, a discrepancy in the corrosion performance of LPBF printed 316L has been reported due to the complex microstructure and defects introduced during LPBF. Therefore, understanding the influence of processing parameters and feedstock on defects and microstructure becomes critical in understanding the processing-corrosion relationships and producing LPBF printed 316L components with reproducible properties. This review presents the influence of feedstock, processing parameters, and post-processing techniques on manufacturing defects, microstructure, and corrosion performance of LPBF printed 316L. Strategies and hypotheses to improve the corrosion resistance of LPBF printed 316L are also presented.},

Additive manufacturing (AM) leads to a new possibility of fabricating Mo structural parts. However, a large number of internal defects appear during welding and AM processes in Mo and its alloys, which is far from well understood and has greatly limited their application. In this paper, the formation and evolution mechanisms of internal defects in Mo are systematically studied, based on the state-of-the-art high-resolution computed tomography. This study demonstrates three main types of defects in Mo: (1) small spherical pores; (2) inverted pear-shaped pores; and (3) cavities. The first type is similar to the observation in welded Mo, while the last two types are not reported before, which are associated with the heat cycling process during AM. The formation mechanism of different types of internal defects is proposed based on the experimental observations. The amount and morphology of internal defects are quantitively and statistically discussed to understand the effect of fabrication parameters, which are further explained according to their formation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Al-Li alloys printed by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) have huge potential for industrial application due to their remarkable advantages. However, the high hot cracking susceptibility (HCS) due to the addition of Li is still a key restraining factor for their rapid development towards such industrial application. Here in this report, hot cracking behaviour of 2195 Al-Li alloys fabricated by LPBF process was investigated by a three-dimensional (3D) X-ray micro-tomography technique. The relationship between the microstructural evolution and the high HCS was established to reveal the hot cracking mechanism for the first time. Observations by X-ray tomography showed large, interconnected cracks with a 3D reticular structure in the printed samples, extending layer by layer from the lamellar cracks in the previous single tracks along the building direction. Contributions to hot cracking were found to origin from the stable liquid film and the stress concentration. The segregation between the Al6CuLi3 and {$\alpha$}-Al matrix contributed to the Al-Cu eutectics along the high-angle grain boundaries in form of intergranular liquid films. Furthermore, it was found that the interfacial layer (intradendritic liquid film) between the Al2Cu and the adjacent LiAlSi or AlCuMgAg exhibited the reduced micro-crack resistance in the interior of the grains. It was pointed out on the basis of the calculation that the higher stability of the intergranular liquid film led to a higher HCS at the grain boundaries as compared to that in the interior of the grains. Furthermore, high internal residual tensile stress provided the driving force for the crack initiation and propagation. In summary, this work contains a practical guide to optimize the powder composition and processing steps of high-quality Al-Li alloys produced by LPBF.},

To improve the quality of built parts, the process monitoring and control has been emphasized as a promising solution. Despite a large number of studies on the development of sensors and instrumentations, the investigation on statistical analysis, modelling and automatic anomalies detection is still at an infant stage. To advance the related research, the intelligent classification methods, support vector machines (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), were proposed for quality level identification in this work. A vision system with high speed camera was used for process images acquisition. The features of different objects including melt pool, plume and spatter were extracted based on the AM process understanding. The corresponding feature vectors were used as the input for the SVM classification. The results indicated the information from different objects is sensitive to different types of quality anomalies. Moreover, the combination of features from these three objects can significantly improve the classification accuracy to 90.1\%. Additionally, the comparison between SVM and CNN was also conducted, the high accuracy of 92.7\% for the CNN model demonstrated that it is a promising method for quality level identification by using the vision system.},

  abstract = {Powder thermal properties play a critical role in laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing, specifically, the reduced effective thermal conductivity compared to that of the solid significantly affects heat conduction, which can influence the melt pool characteristics, and consequently, the part mechanical properties. This study intends to indirectly measure the thermal conductivity of metallic powder, nickel-based super alloy 625 (IN625) and Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64), in LPBF using a combined approach that consists of laser flash analysis, finite element (FE) heat transfer modeling and a multivariate inverse method. The test specimens were designed and fabricated by a LPBF system to encapsulate powder in a hollow disk to imitate powder-bed conditions. The as-built specimens were then subjected to laser flash testing to measure the transient thermal response. Next, an FE model replicate the hollow disk samples and laser flash testing was developed. A multi-point optimization algorithm was used to inversely extract the thermal conductivity of LPBF powder from the FE model based on the measured transient thermal response. The results indicate that the thermal conductivity of IN625 powder used in LPBF ranges from 0.65\,W/(m{$\bullet$}K) to 1.02\,W/(m{$\bullet$}K) at 100\,{$^\circ$}C and 500\,{$^\circ$}C, respectively, showing a linear relationship with the temperature. On the other hand, Ti64 powder has a lower thermal conductivity than IN625 powder, about 35\% to 40\% smaller. However, the thermal conductivity ratio of the powder to the respective solid counterpart is quite similar between the two materials, about 4.2\% to 6.9\% for IN625 and 3.4\% to 5.2\% for Ti64.},

We found that the boundary of the keyhole porosity regime in power-velocity space is sharp and smooth, varying only slightly between the bare plate and powder bed.

In this study, the current research status and future research trends for LPBF of Zn-based implants are reviewed from comprehensive viewpoints including formation quality, microstructure feature, and performance. The influences of powder characteristics and process parameters on formation quality are described systematically. The microstructure evolution, mechanical properties, as well as the degradation behavior are also discussed. Finally, the research perspectives for LPBF of Zn are summarized, aiming to provide guideline for future study.},

  abstract = {To evaluate artifact reduction by virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) and metal artifact reduction algorithms (MAR) as well as the combination of both approaches (VMIMAR) compared to conventional CT images (CI) as standard of reference. In this retrospective study, 35 patients were included who underwent spectral-detector CT (SDCT) with additional MAR-reconstructions due to artifacts from coils or clips. CI, VMI, MAR and VMIMAR (range: 100--200\,keV, 10\,keV-increment) were reconstructed. Region-of-interest based objective analysis was performed by assessing mean and standard deviation of attenuation (HU) in hypo- and hyperdense artifacts from coils and clips. Visually, extent of artifact reduction and diagnostic assessment were rated. Compared to CI, VMI\,{$\geq$}\,100\,keV, MAR and VMIMAR between 100--200\,keV increased attenuation in hypoattenuating artifacts (CI/VMI200keV/MAR/VMIMAR200keV, HU: -77.6\,{\textpm}\,81.1/-65.1\,{\textpm}\,103.2/-36.9\,{\textpm}\,27.7/-21.1\,{\textpm}\,26.7) and decreased attenuation in hyperattenuating artifacts (HU: 47.4\,{\textpm}\,32.3/42.1\,{\textpm}\,50.2/29.5\,{\textpm}\,18.9/20.8\,{\textpm}\,25.8). However, differences were only significant for MAR in hypodense and VMIMAR in hypo- and hyperdense artifacts (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Visually, hypo- and hyperdense artifacts were significantly reduced compared to CI by VMI{$\geq$}140/100keV, MAR and VMIMAR{$\geq$}100keV. Diagnostic assessment of surrounding brain tissue was significantly improved in VMI{$\geq$}100keV, MAR and VMIMAR{$\geq$}100keV. The combination of VMI and MAR facilitates a significant reduction of artifacts adjacent to intracranial coils and clips. Hence, if available, these techniques should be combined for optimal reduction of artifacts following intracranial aneurysm treatment.},
